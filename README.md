🌌 StarWarsApp

StarWarsApp is a Java-based console application inspired by the Star Wars universe, designed as a learning project that evolves step-by-step through the main features of the Java ecosystem. The goal is to progress from core Java fundamentals to a fully containerized web application using Spring Boot, Docker, and a modern front-end framework.

🎯 Project Goal

This project serves as a roadmap to master Java and its ecosystem:

Core Java: Object-oriented programming (OOP), classes, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism.

Mock Persistence Layer: Simulating databases using Java collections.

JDBC + PostgreSQL: Connecting to a real database using Java.

Spring Boot: REST APIs, JPA, validation, exception handling, and JWT-based authentication.

Docker: Containerizing the back-end and database.

Front-end Integration: Consuming the API from a modern front-end app.

CI/CD + Cloud Deployment: Automating build and deployment pipelines, pushing the app to the cloud.


🧠 Concepts Covered

✅ OOP: Inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction

✅ Flow control: if, switch, loops

✅ Class design and structure

✅ Separation of concerns

✅ Back-end architecture evolution


🖥️ Future Front-end Options


🔷 Angular?

⚛️ React?

(Optional) Vue.js – Lightweight and easy to integrate.
